❖Introduction :
RK Events is a dynamic and user-centric web-based platform
developed to automate the registration process for various
events conducted in academic institutions, organizations, and
social groups.
In the traditional setup, event registrations are handled
manually, often resulting in time consumption, data
inconsistency, human errors, and operational inefficiency.
This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a centralized
and digital solution that streamlines the complete registration
workflow. Users can browse upcoming events, register
through a simple form, and receive instant confirmation.
Meanwhile, organizers can access participant data, manage
event entries, and generate registration reports efficiently.
❖Platform Used for Proposed Work :
 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 Backend: PHP
 Text Editor/IDE: VS Code
❖Objectives :
• To design and develop a responsive web
application for event registration.
• To reduce manual effort and paperwork in
event management.
• To securely store participant data using a
relational database.
• To provide users with a seamless and
interactive registration process.
• To enable event organizers to view, manage,
and export registration data.
• To lay the foundation for future enhancements
like email confirmation and user login.
❖Scope :
The RK Events website is applicable for colleges,
schools, companies, and clubs to manage multiple
event registrations digitally. It allows user-friendly
navigation, real-time data saving, and simple admin
management.
In future iterations, it can be expanded with:
• Admin dashboard
• Authentication and role-based access
• Email/SMS notifications
• QR code based entry
• Multi-event filtering and reports
It offers long-term scalability and usability for realworld applications.
